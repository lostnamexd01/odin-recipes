    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Neapolitan pizza is a traditional Italian pizza that originated in Naples. It is characterized by its thin, soft crust, simple toppings, and high-quality ingredients. The classic version, Pizza Margherita, features tomatoes, fresh mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and a drizzle of olive oil.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g (4 cups) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>325ml (1⅓ cups) water</li>
        <li>10g (2 tsp) salt</li>
        <li>2g (½ tsp) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>200g (7 oz) San Marzano tomatoes, crushed</li>
        <li>250g (9 oz) fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in water.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the water to the flour mixture, stirring until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise for 2 hours at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to its highest setting (usually around 250°C or 482°F).</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 2-3 equal portions and shape each into a ball. Let them rest for another 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, stretch each dough ball into a thin circle.</li>
        <li>Spread crushed San Marzano tomatoes over the base, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Add slices of fresh mozzarella and a few basil leaves on top.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and bake in the preheated oven for about 7-10 minutes until the crust is golden and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, add more fresh basil if desired, slice, and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
